## Mapping London's Urban Heat Islands using Landsat
Use `config.py` to input credentials and run `extract.py` and `analyse.py`. 

These scripts use download, clean and analyse data from NASA's Landsat satellite's API. 

Then `plot.py` and `app.py` visualise the data. `demo_london.ipynb` is a notebook containing the full process with explanations and commmentary at each steps.

Links to raw geographic data in each script. Landsat info here: https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/
